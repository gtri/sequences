This repository includes an example application of gradient descent
to polyphase sequence optimization.  The approach is based on a 
paper submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic 
Systems.  This is a work in progress: in the future additional 
examples will be added to illustrate other optimization tasks.
